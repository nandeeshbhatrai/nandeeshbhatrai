## 🧠 Origin Story
> *“Not all engineers build apps.  
Some build systems. Some build intelligence.  
I build both.”*

I’m **Nandeesh**, a fourth-year Computer Science undergraduate at **IIT Goa**, driven by a fascination for **how complex systems behave**, whether that system is a **cloud infrastructure**, a **neural network**, or a **competitive programming problem under time pressure**.

From automating **Google Cloud’s internal infrastructure** to predicting **macroeconomic trends using news sentiment**, my journey blends **engineering rigor**, **mathematical thinking**, and **strategic problem-solving**.
